## User Story 
Because the novel coronavirus had a tremendous impact on everything we wanted to create a similar experience to browsing a museum.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Ability to search for keywords
* Ability to filter by categories
* Display picture of the item in museum
* Display information that could be * found on information card
* Create an opportunity for art appreciation


## Description
The Met Art Generator provides randomly generated art based on the user's search parameters. Additionally, the site displays the artist's name, title of work, time period, medium used, and location inside the Met. On the site, the user will have the option to follow the [Come Visit Us!](https://aarongermaine.github.io/group_project/visit.html) link to learn the history of the Met musuem and get the location from its interactive map.

## Usage
Open the [Met Art Generator](https://aarongermaine.github.io/group_project/) in your favorite browser. Once the page is loaded, choose your search parameters for your art work from the provided drop down menus. Don't see what you're looking for? Enter your search criteria into the provided search bar instead! Once your criteria has been processed, a piece of art from the Met will hang in the golden grame. Additionally, the information card will be filled out with an overview about the piece. If you are wanting to find this piece in the <strong> actual </strong> Met, follow the provided link to see where it hangs in the museum, along with a more in depth description  of the art. Want to learn more about the Met itself, or perhaps swing by for a visit? Follow the [Come Visit Us!](https://aarongermaine.github.io/group_project/visit.html) link. There you will find a brief history of the musuem and an interactive map to show you where to go. 

## Installation 
This application will work on all current browsers.

## Reflections 
In  the future, we could see our application being utilized in many different ways to help bring art and education to more people. Here are a few ideas we had on the future of the Met Art Generator: 
* It could be used in a more focused way to promote specific temporary exhibits by adding a parameter to all api calls from The Met.
* It could be linked to multiple musuems to bring more traffic to them. 
* The appilication could be set up to default to a local museum to get the public out to see art locally.
