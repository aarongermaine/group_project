## User Story 
As an art enthusiast, I want to be able to have art randomly generated for me to look at and enjoy. 

## Description
The met art generator provides randomly generated art based on the user's search parameters. Additionally, the site displays the artist's name, title of work, time period, medium used, and location inside the Met. On the site, the user will have the option to follow the [Come Visit Us!](<a> href=# </a>) link to learn the history of the Met musuem and get the location from its interactive map. 

## Mock Up


## Usage
Open the [Met Art Generator](https://aarongermaine.github.io/group_project/) in your favorite browser. Once the page is loaded, choose your search parameters for your art work from the provided drop down menus. Don't see what you're looking for? Enter your search criteria into the provided search bar instead! Once your criteria has been processed, a piece of art from the Met will hang in the golden grame. Additionally, the information card will be filled out with all the ??? words about the piece. If you are wanting to find this piece in the <strong> actual </strong> Met, follow the provided link to see where it hangs in the museum. Want to learn more about the Met itself, or perhaps swing by for a visit? Follow the [Come Visit Us!](<a> Come Visit Us </a>) link. There you will find a brief history of the musuem and an interactive map to show you where to go. 

## Installation 
This application will work on all current browsers.
